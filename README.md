# CarolineClassroomOrganizer
A Java application used for organizing the layout of desks and students in a classroom.

### Description

This application's function is to track, edit and organize a classroom layout by assigning desks and students to the 2D grid. Afterwards a teacher can save that specific layout in both .CSV and .RAF format. They can also open these files afterwards to modify the layout or access it later if necessary.

The application features a GUI with a 2D numbered grid in the middle, and several text boxes to enter other information such as Teacher, Room, Class, and Date.

### Technologies Used

Developed in IntelliJ with The Java Programming Language.

External Libraries were not utilized.

### How to Use and Install

There is no executable, therefore it must be imported into a relevant environment that
can run Java code.

The application features a sort button to alphabetically order all students in the 2D array and display them in a new window. It also includes a search function where when a student's name is entered into the text box beside it, regardless of case, it will display the position of the student in a new window whilst also highlighting them in the 2D array.

Consult the Technical Report for the User Manual for further information.
